## Product Overview

**What is Attain?**

Attain Finance is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) based application that connects your financial accounts directly to your AI chat assistant. Whether you use ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, Attain lets you have natural conversations about your finances with real-time access to your account data.

**Who is it for?**

Anyone who wants to understand and manage their finances through natural conversation with their preferred AI assistant. Users who are already comfortable with AI chat interfaces and want to extend that convenience to their financial life.

**What problem does it solve?**

Traditional finance apps require switching contexts, learning new interfaces, and navigating complex dashboards. Attain eliminates this friction by bringing your financial data directly into the AI assistant you already use daily. Instead of opening multiple apps to check balances, analyze spending, or track net worth, you simply ask your AI assistant.

## Core Features

### 1. Universal AI Assistant Integration
Connect to ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini using the MCP standard protocol. Use whichever AI assistant you prefer—Attain works with all of them.

### 2. Secure Account Linking
Connect credit cards, bank accounts, and investment accounts through secure, industry-standard authentication. One-click authorization flow generates a secure link directly in your chat.

### 3. Real-Time Account Data
View all account balances in real-time. See your complete financial picture without switching apps or logging into multiple accounts.

### 4. Net Worth Tracking
Connect multiple accounts to automatically calculate and track your total net worth. Get a comprehensive view of your financial health across all your accounts.

### 5. Natural Language Interface
No dashboards, no buttons, no menus. Just ask questions in plain English and get instant answers about your finances.

### 6. Transaction History & Analysis
View all your transactions across connected accounts. See exactly what you're purchasing and how you're spending money. Ask your AI to analyze patterns, find trends, or identify unusual spending.

### 7. AI-Powered Visualization
Generate custom bar graphs, line charts, and spending visualizations on demand. Ask for a chart showing your spending by category, trends over time, or any custom view you need—your AI creates it instantly.

### 8. Smart Budgeting with AI Categorization
Set budgets and let AI automatically categorize each expense. No manual tagging required—AI understands what each transaction is and assigns it to the right category.

### 9. Flexible Budget Periods
Create rolling budgets (last 7 days, last 30 days) or specific time period budgets (monthly, quarterly, custom date ranges). Track your spending in whatever timeframe makes sense for you.

### 10. Investment Portfolio Tracking
View all your current investments across connected accounts. Monitor holdings, performance, and allocation without switching to separate investment apps.

### 11. Debt Management & Payback Analysis
List all your current debts (credit cards, loans, mortgages) and analyze payback periods. Get insights on interest costs and optimal payoff strategies based on your actual financial situation.

### 12. Context-Aware Financial Decisions
Make everyday decisions with your financial context built-in. Planning travel, shopping, or major purchases? Your AI assistant can instantly tell you if it fits your budget, considering your current balances, spending patterns, and financial goals.

Create your Attain account and log in to access your financial dashboard.

### Step 2: Connect Your Accounts

### Step 3: Authorize & Sync
Click the link to securely log in to your financial provider (bank, credit card, investment account, etc.). Your account is automatically synced with Attain.

### Step 4: Ask Anything
Your financial data is now accessible through natural conversation. Ask about balances, spending patterns, net worth, or investment advice—all within your AI chat interface.

## Competitive Differentiation

**What makes Attain different?**

Attain is built purely to work through YOUR AI agent—not ours. Other financial services want you to visit their website, download their app, or use their custom AI assistant. Attain brings your financial data to the AI assistant you already use and trust.

**The key difference:**
- **Other services**: "Come to our app/site and use our AI"
- **Attain**: "Use your AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) and we'll bring your finances there"

This means you stay in your workflow, use the AI you prefer, and never have to context-switch to yet another financial app or learn another interface.

Not focusing on traditional competition at this stage—focused on validating user demand and building something people actually want to use. The closed beta will help us understand if users find value in having their financial data integrated directly into their AI chat experience.

## Target User Profile

**Primary audience:**

Financially literate individuals who already use AI chat assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) as their primary interface for work and decision-making. These are people who trust AI to help them think through problems and make decisions.

**User needs:**

- Clean, automatically updated financial data for their own analysis
- Comprehensive financial review capabilities (e.g., when making major decisions like buying a house)
- Integration of financial context into their existing chat-based workflow
- Real-time access to complete financial picture without app switching
- Ability to ask complex financial questions and get answers based on their actual data

**User pain points:**

- Switching between multiple finance apps disrupts their chat-based workflow
- Manual data gathering when making financial decisions is time-consuming
- Traditional finance dashboards don't allow for custom analysis and questions
- Financial data isn't available where they're already making decisions (in their AI chat)
