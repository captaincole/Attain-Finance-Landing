## FAQ.md (Separate Page)

### What is Attain?
Attain connects your financial accounts (banks, credit cards, investments) to your AI assistant via the MCP protocol. Instead of opening separate finance apps, you access your money through natural conversation in ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

### Which AI assistants does Attain work with?
ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard will work with Attain.

### How do I connect my accounts?
Just ask your AI assistant to "connect my bank account" or "add my credit card." Your AI will generate a secure authorization link. Click it, log in to your financial provider, and your account syncs automatically.

### Is my financial data secure?
Yes. Attain uses industry-standard authentication and encryption. We never see your login credentialsâ€”you authorize directly with your bank or financial provider using their secure login system.

### What can I do with Attain?
- Check account balances and net worth
- View and analyze transactions
- Create custom spending visualizations and charts
- Set and track budgets with AI categorization
- Monitor investments and debt
- Get financial context for everyday decisions (e.g., "Can I afford this?")

### Do I need to download an app?
No. Attain works entirely through your existing AI chat interface. No app downloads, no new logins, no separate dashboards.

### How is Attain different from other finance apps?
Other services want you to use their app or their AI. Attain brings your finances to the AI assistant you already use and trust. You stay in your workflowâ€”we just provide the data.

### What does the closed beta include?
Full access to connect accounts, view transactions, track budgets, analyze spending, and make financial decisions through your AI chat. We're looking for feedback to improve the experience before public launch.

### How much does Attain cost?
The closed beta is free. Pricing for the public launch will be announced later.

### What if I have issues or questions?
[Email support address or Discord/Slack link TBD]

## Notes
- Keep hero messaging simple and clearâ€”explain what it is in 5 seconds
- Demo examples should be realistic and relatable (not overly complex)
- FAQ should address skepticism (security, "why not just use Mint/YNAB?", etc.)
