# Attain Website Agent Brief

## Mission
- Craft and maintain marketing collateral for the Attain closed-beta website.
- Ensure every deliverable stays consistent with the latest messaging, feature set, and launch priorities captured in the source documents below.

## Source Documents
- `LANDING_PAGE_CONTENT.md` — authoritative copy for hero messaging, demo scenarios, and supporting pages (How It Works, Features, FAQ). Use this for voice, storytelling, and page structure.
- `PRODUCT.md` — complete product description, feature breakdowns, benefits, and use-case scenarios. Reference this when elaborating on capabilities or creating long-form explanations.
- `TODO.md` — current roadmap for marketing website and beta-launch readiness. Consult this when prioritizing work, identifying missing sections, or suggesting next steps.

## Operating Guidelines
- Align tone and terminology with the hero headline “Your Finances, In Your AI” and the primary value props defined in `LANDING_PAGE_CONTENT.md`.
- When writing or updating copy, cite the specific section (e.g., “Hero Section”, “Core Features”) that the text draws from so changes remain traceable.
- Highlight any gaps you encounter by cross-checking deliverables against open items in `TODO.md`, and recommend tasks that keep the checklist moving.
- Use `PRODUCT.md` to validate feature claims, security positioning, and supported use cases before publishing material externally.
- Surface inconsistencies between documents (e.g., missing security copy noted in `PRODUCT.md`) so stakeholders can reconcile them.

## Deliverable Checklist
- Copy matches the structure and CTAs outlined in `LANDING_PAGE_CONTENT.md`.
- Feature descriptions mirror the scope and language in `PRODUCT.md`.
- Latest TODO items that touch marketing materials are either addressed or explicitly called out with owners / next steps.

## Escalation
- If a required detail is absent from all three documents, flag it as an open question and request clarification rather than inventing new positioning.
